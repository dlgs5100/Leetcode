## 題目說明
    
You are given an integer array nums and an integer k. You may partition nums into one or more subsequences such that each element in nums appears in exactly one of the subsequences.

Return the minimum number of subsequences needed such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subsequence is at most k.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,1,2,5], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can partition nums into the two subsequences [3,1,2] and [6,5].
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 3 - 1 = 2.
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 6 - 5 = 1.
Since two subsequences were created, we return 2. It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can partition nums into the two subsequences [1,2] and [3].
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequence is 2 - 1 = 1.
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequence is 3 - 3 = 0.
Since two subsequences were created, we return 2. Note that another optimal solution is to partition nums into the two subsequences [1] and [2,3].
Example 3:

Input: nums = [2,2,4,5], k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can partition nums into the three subsequences [2,2], [4], and [5].
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the first subsequences is 2 - 2 = 0.
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the second subsequences is 4 - 4 = 0.
The difference between the maximum and minimum value in the third subsequences is 5 - 5 = 0.
Since three subsequences were created, we return 3. It can be shown that 3 is the minimum number of subsequences needed.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
0 <= nums[i] <= 105
0 <= k <= 105

## 解法
### 1. sort and select
#### 思路

先sort過，並將第一個值設為minValue和maxValue，接著遍歷數組，找到該組當前的minValue和maxValue，如果minValue和maxValue的差大於k，就代表是新的一組。

#### 代碼
```c++
/*
    1. brute force: O(n^2)
    2. sort and select O(nlogn)
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int partitionArray(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (n == 0)
            return 0;

        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int result = 1, minValue = nums[0], maxValue = nums[0];
        for (int idx = 1; idx < n; idx++) {
            minValue = min(minValue, nums[idx]);
            maxValue = max(maxValue, nums[idx]);
            if (maxValue - minValue > k) {
                result++;
                maxValue = minValue = nums[idx];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
