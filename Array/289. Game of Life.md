## 題目說明
    
According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
The next state of the board is determined by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state of the m x n grid board. In this process, births and deaths occur simultaneously.

Given the current state of the board, update the board to reflect its next state.

Note that you do not need to return anything.

 

Example 1:


Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
Example 2:


Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
 

Constraints:

m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 25
board[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 

Follow up:

Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?

## 解法
### 1. in-place(two pass)
#### 思路

這題是要找出下一個世代的boad狀況

若自己本來是活的，且鄰居有2或3個是活的，該點就是活的；反之，就會是死的。

若自己本來是死的，且鄰居有3個是活的，該點就是活的；反之，就會是死的。

先traversal一次，標記這個世代到下個世代的轉變，接著再traversal一次替換掉。

#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int nRow = board.size(), nCol = board[0].size();
        vector<pair<int,int>> directs = {{-1,0},{1,0},{0,-1},{0,1},{-1,-1},{-1,1},{1,-1},{1,1}};

        // 第 1 趟：標記 -1 (活→死)  和 2 (死→活)
        for (int row = 0; row < nRow; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < nCol; ++col) {
                int live = 0;
                for (const auto &direct : directs) {
                    int nbrRow = row + direct.first, nbrCol = col + direct.second;
                    if (nbrRow < 0 || nbrRow >= board.size() || nbrCol < 0 || nbrCol >= board[0].size())
                        continue;
                    
                    if (board[nbrRow][nbrCol] == 1 || board[nbrRow][nbrCol] == -1)
                        live++;
                }

                if (board[row][col] == 1 && (live < 2 || live > 3))
                    board[row][col] = -1;

                if (board[row][col] == 0 && live == 3)
                    board[row][col] = 2;
            }
        }

        for (int row = 0; row < nRow; ++row) {
            for (int col = 0; col < nCol; ++col) {
                if (board[row][col] == -1)
                    board[row][col] = 0;
                else if (board[row][col] == 2)
                    board[row][col] = 1;
            }
        }
    }
};
```
