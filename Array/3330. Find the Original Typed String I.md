## 題目說明
    
Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "abbcccc"

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "abbcccc", "abbccc", "abbcc", "abbc", and "abcccc".

Example 2:

Input: word = "abcd"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "abcd".

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaaa"

Output: 4

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 100
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

## 解法
### 1. one pass
#### 思路

用hash map會遇到"ere"這種字串不連續的case，所以無法使用。

可以先把result設為n，假設所有字母皆重複，接著判斷一個一個判斷，如果該字母和前一個字母不重複，則代表沒有打錯的可能，因此可能結果-1。

#### 代碼
```c++
/*
    word = "abbcccc"
    origin = "abbcccc", "abcccc", "abbccc", "abbcc", "abbc"

    word = "ere"
    origin = "ere"
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int possibleStringCount(string word) {
        int n = word.size(), result = n;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (word[i] != word[i-1])
                result--;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
