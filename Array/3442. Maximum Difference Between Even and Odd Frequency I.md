---

## 題目說明
    
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the maximum difference diff = freq(a1) - freq(a2) between the frequency of characters a1 and a2 in the string such that:

a1 has an odd frequency in the string.
a2 has an even frequency in the string.
Return this maximum difference.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aaaaabbc"

Output: 3

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 5, and 'b' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 5 - 2 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abcabcab"

Output: 1

Explanation:

The character 'a' has an odd frequency of 3, and 'c' has an even frequency of 2.
The maximum difference is 3 - 2 = 1.
 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 100
s consists only of lowercase English letters.
s contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.

## 解法
### 1. hash map
#### 思路



#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDifference(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> wordMap;
        for (char c : s) {
            wordMap[c]++;
        }

        int maxOdd = 0, minEven = 100;
        for (const auto &wordPair : wordMap) {
            int cnt = wordPair.second;

            if (cnt % 2) {
                maxOdd = max(maxOdd, cnt);
            }
            else {
                minEven = min(minEven, cnt);
            }
        }

        return maxOdd-minEven;
    }
};

```
