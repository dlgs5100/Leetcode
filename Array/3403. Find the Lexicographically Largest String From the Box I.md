## 題目說明
    
You are given a string word, and an integer numFriends.

Alice is organizing a game for her numFriends friends. There are multiple rounds in the game, where in each round:

word is split into numFriends non-empty strings, such that no previous round has had the exact same split.
All the split words are put into a box.
Find the lexicographically largest string from the box after all the rounds are finished.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "dbca", numFriends = 2

Output: "dbc"

Explanation: 

All possible splits are:

"d" and "bca".
"db" and "ca".
"dbc" and "a".
Example 2:

Input: word = "gggg", numFriends = 4

Output: "g"

Explanation: 

The only possible split is: "g", "g", "g", and "g".

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 5 * 103
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= numFriends <= word.length

## 解法
### 1. brute-force
#### 思路

暴力法。

#### 代碼
```c++
// s = “a'e'bdc”, numFriends = 3
class Solution {
public:
    string answerString(string word, int numFriends) {
        if (numFriends == 1) {
            return word;
        }

        string answer;

        for (int idx = 0; idx < word.size(); idx++) {
            answer = max(answer, word.substr(idx, word.size() - (numFriends - 1)));
        }

        return answer;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n^2)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
