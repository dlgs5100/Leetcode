## 題目說明
    
There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

 

Example 1:

Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
Example 2:

Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
 

Constraints:

n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104

## 解法
### 1. Greedy
#### 思路

若題目問最多或最少幾個，可以想貪婪方法。

可以透過左到右更新一次，並從右到左再更新一次的方法，得到最少的糖果數量，但第二次更新需要確保不會覆蓋到第一次更新的結果，讓他變小。

    
#### 代碼

```c++
/*
    1. number or children: n, 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
    2. each child must have at least one candy
    3. higher rating get more candies than neightbors
    4. return minimum total number of candies

    basic case:
        1. ratings = [2,1,0]
            candies = [1,1,1] => [3,2,1]
        2. ratings = [0,1,2]
            candies = [1,1,1] => [1,2,1] => [1,2,3]
        3. ratings = [1,0,2]
            candies = [1,1,1] => [1,1,2] => [2,1,2]
        
    1. greedy
        for (idx: 1~n-1)
            if (ratings[idx] > ratings[idx-1])
        for (idx: n-2~0)
            if (ratings[idx] > ratings[idx+1])
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        // [1,3,4,5,2] => [1,1,1,1,1] => [1,2,3,4,1] => [1,2,3,4,1]
        int n = ratings.size();
        vector<int> candies(n,1);

        for (int idx = 1; idx < n; idx++) {
            if (ratings[idx] > ratings[idx-1]) {
                candies[idx] = candies[idx-1] + 1;
            }
        }

        for (int idx = n-2; idx >= 0; idx--) {
            if (ratings[idx] > ratings[idx+1]) {
                candies[idx] = max(candies[idx], candies[idx+1] + 1);
            }
        }

        return accumulate(candies.begin(), candies.end(), 0);
    }
};
```
