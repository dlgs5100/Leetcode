## 題目說明
    
You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0

Output: 3

Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.

Example 2:

Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.

 

Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 105
0 <= k <= 105
word consists only of lowercase English letters.

## 解法
### 1. Greedy
#### 思路

這題是問最少要刪掉多少元素，才能讓所有頻率差都小於等於k，因此可以考慮用greedy。

1. 首先計算出所有字母的頻率
2. 固定一個字母，看其他字母的頻率，如果fixFreq > delFreq，代表其他字母比他更少，但我們要確保他是最少的，所以直接刪除所有的其他字母(currDelete += delFreq)；反之，就要讓其他字母的頻率和固定字母的頻率差在k以內，但不能小於0。

#### 代碼

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumDeletions(string word, int k) {
        vector<int> freq(26,0);

        for (char c : word) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }

        int result = INT_MAX;
        for (int fixFreq : freq) {
            int currDelete = 0;

            for (int delFreq : freq) {
                if (fixFreq > delFreq) {
                    currDelete += delFreq;
                }
                else {
                    currDelete += max(0, delFreq - fixFreq - k);
                }
            }

            result = min(result, currDelete);
        }

        return result;
    }
};

```
