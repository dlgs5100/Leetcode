## 題目說明
    
You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.

Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.

Note:

The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1001010", k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 5 is "00010", as this number is equal to 2 in decimal.
Note that "00100" and "00101" are also possible, which are equal to 4 and 5 in decimal, respectively.
The length of this subsequence is 5, so 5 is returned.
Example 2:

Input: s = "00101001", k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: "000001" is the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to 1, as this number is equal to 1 in decimal.
The length of this subsequence is 6, so 6 is returned.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.
1 <= k <= 109

## 解法
### 1. Greedy
#### 思路

加入的數值會因為右邊的位數影響而變化，因此從右往左加入。

不需要考慮0，因為無論如何都可以加入0。
僅需要考慮1，如果該位1(pow)加上val，不會超過k，cnt就可以+1，最後再加入所有0的數量即可。
    
#### 代碼

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int longestSubsequence(string s, int k) {
        int val = 0, cnt = 0, pow = 1;
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (val + pow > k) {
                break;
            }

            if (s[i] == '1') {
                val += pow;
                cnt++;
            }

            pow <<= 1;
        }

        return count(begin(s), end(s), '0') + cnt;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
