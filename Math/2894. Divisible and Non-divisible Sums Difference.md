## 題目說明
    
You are given positive integers n and m.

Define two integers as follows:

num1: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are not divisible by m.
num2: The sum of all integers in the range [1, n] (both inclusive) that are divisible by m.
Return the integer num1 - num2.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 10, m = 3
Output: 19
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are not divisible by 3 are [1,2,4,5,7,8,10], num1 is the sum of those integers = 37.
- Integers in the range [1, 10] that are divisible by 3 are [3,6,9], num2 is the sum of those integers = 18.
We return 37 - 18 = 19 as the answer.
Example 2:

Input: n = 5, m = 6
Output: 15
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are not divisible by 6 are [1,2,3,4,5], num1 is the sum of those integers = 15.
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 6 are [], num2 is the sum of those integers = 0.
We return 15 - 0 = 15 as the answer.
Example 3:

Input: n = 5, m = 1
Output: -15
Explanation: In the given example:
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are not divisible by 1 are [], num1 is the sum of those integers = 0.
- Integers in the range [1, 5] that are divisible by 1 are [1,2,3,4,5], num2 is the sum of those integers = 15.
We return 0 - 15 = -15 as the answer.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 1000

## 解法
### 1. brute force
#### 思路

迴圈跑一次。

#### 代碼
```c++
/*
    num1: idx1 = 1~n which idx1 % m != 0
    num2: idx2 = 1~n which idx2 % m == 0
    return num1 - num2

    1 <= n, m <= 1000

    basic case:
        1. n = 10, m = 2
            num1 = 1+3+5+7+9 = 25
            num2 = 2+4+6+8+10 = 30
            num1 - num2 = -5
        2. n = 10(arbitrary), m = 1
            num1 = 0
            num2 = 1+2+...+10 = 55
    
    Method 1. brute force
    Method 2. math (use in m, n is big)
        num1 = (1 + ... + n) - num2
        num2 = m + 2m + ... + km, k = n / m
        num1 - num2 = (1 + ... + n) - 2 * num2 = (1 + ... + n) - 2 * (m + 2m + ... + km)
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
        for (int idx = 1; idx <= n; idx++) {
            if (idx % m != 0)
                num1 += idx;
            else
                num2 += idx;
        }

        return num1 - num2;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)

### 2. math
#### 思路

用梯形公式。

#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int k = n / m;
        int num1 = (1 + n) * n / 2, num2 = (1 + k) * k / 2 * m;

        return num1 - 2 * num2; 
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(1)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
