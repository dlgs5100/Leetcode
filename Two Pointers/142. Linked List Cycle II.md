# LeetCode 142. Linked List Cycle II

難度：Medium  
連結：[LeetCode 題目連結](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/description/)

---

## 題目說明
    
Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
Example 3:


Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
-105 <= Node.val <= 105
pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
 

Follow up: Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?

## 解法
### 1. two pointers
#### 思路

這題類似於Leetcode 141，差別在於，需要找到造成環的頭。

因此需要將fast指標拉回head，接著fast和slow同時走，直到碰到的點即為造成環的點。

#### 代碼
```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL)
            return nullptr;
            
        ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;

        while (fast && fast->next) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
            if (slow == fast)
                break;
        }

        if (fast == nullptr || fast->next == nullptr)
            return nullptr;

        fast = head;
        while (slow != fast) {
            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next;
        }

        return slow;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(N)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
