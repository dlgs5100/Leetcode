## 題目說明
    
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
Example 2:

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
There is at least one word in s.
 

Follow-up: If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

## 解法
### 1. two pointers
#### 思路

先全部反轉，接著再以word為單位反轉，但要記得把頭的空白蓋掉，尾的空白resize。

#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string reverseWords(string s) {
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        int n = s.size(), left = 0, right = 0, i = 0;

        while (i < n) {
            // find word
            while (i < n && s[i] == ' ')
                i++;

            if (i == n)
                break;
            
            // cover the space
            while (i < n && s[i] != ' ')
                s[right++] = s[i++];

            reverse(s.begin() + left, s.begin() + right);
            s[right++] = ' ';
            left = right;
            i++;
        }

        s.resize(right - 1);
        return s;
    }
};
```
