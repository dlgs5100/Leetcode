## 題目說明
    
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
 

Constraints:

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
All the integers of nums are unique.
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

## 解法
### 1. Binary Search
#### 思路

此題是要求我們在有rotate的ascending order array中，找到最小值。從[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]可以看出，如果在最小值的左邊，那一定會大於right；反之，則會小於等於right。

這題的核心概念是收斂(converge)位置，因此用left<right(left==right即為答案，回傳left或right都可)。

#### 代碼
```c++
/*
    ascending order
    mid at left: [2,3,4,5,1] => mid > right
    mid at right: [5,1,2,3,4] => mid < right
*/
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[right])
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }

        return nums[left];
    }
};
```
