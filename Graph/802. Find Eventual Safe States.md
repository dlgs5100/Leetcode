## 題目說明
    
There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

 

Example 1:

Illustration of graph
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]
Explanation: The given graph is shown above.
Nodes 5 and 6 are terminal nodes as there are no outgoing edges from either of them.
Every path starting at nodes 2, 4, 5, and 6 all lead to either node 5 or 6.
Example 2:

Input: graph = [[1,2,3,4],[1,2],[3,4],[0,4],[]]
Output: [4]
Explanation:
Only node 4 is a terminal node, and every path starting at node 4 leads to node 4.
 

Constraints:

n == graph.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= graph[i].length <= n
0 <= graph[i][j] <= n - 1
graph[i] is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
The graph may contain self-loops.
The number of edges in the graph will be in the range [1, 4 * 104].

## 解法
### 1. Kahn算法(bfs)
#### 思路

拓樸排序
1. find terminal node: 5, 6
2. because we need to find from terminal node, we have to build reverseGraph
3. calculate outDegree
4. push idx with 0 outDegree to queue

#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> eventualSafeNodes(vector<vector<int>>& graph) {
        int n = graph.size();
        vector<vector<int>> reverseGraph(n);
        vector<int> outDegree(n, 0);

        // u: start, v: end
        for (int u = 0; u < n; ++u) {
            for (int v : graph[u]) {
                reverseGraph[v].push_back(u);
                outDegree[u]++;
            }
        }

        queue<int> nodeQue;
        for (int idx = 0; idx < n; ++ idx) {
            if (outDegree[idx] == 0)
                nodeQue.push(idx);
        }

        vector<bool> safe(n, false);
        while (!nodeQue.empty()) {
            int curr = nodeQue.front();
            nodeQue.pop();
            safe[curr] = true;

            for (int prev : reverseGraph[curr]) {
                outDegree[prev]--;
                if (outDegree[prev] == 0) {
                    nodeQue.push(prev);
                }
            }
        }

        vector<int> result;
        for (int idx = 0; idx < n; ++idx) {
            if (safe[idx])
                result.push_back(idx);
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n+m) =>n = 節點數 graph.size(), m = 有向邊總數 ∑ graph[u].size()
- 空間複雜度：O(n+m)
