## 題目說明
    
    You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

    Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [2,3,2]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
    Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
    Example 3:

    Input: nums = [1,2,3]
    Output: 3
    

    Constraints:

    1 <= nums.length <= 100
    0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
    

## 解法
### 1. Bottom-Up with Tabulation
#### 思路

概念跟Leetcode 198相同，差別在於此題房子是呈現circle，所以偷了第一間就沒辦法偷最後一間，因此透過這個概念，將Leetcode 198改寫，判斷"偷第一間但不偷最後一間"和"不偷第一間但偷最後一間"，哪一個結果較好。
    
#### 代碼

```c++
class Solution {
private:
    int robInRange(vector<int>& nums, int start, int end) {
        int n_1Amount = 0, n_2Amount = 0;

        if (end - start + 1 == 1)
            return nums[start];

        n_2Amount = nums[start];
        n_1Amount = max(nums[start], nums[start + 1]);
        
        for (int idx = start + 2; idx <= end; idx++) {
            int curAmount = max(n_1Amount, n_2Amount + nums[idx]);
            n_2Amount = n_1Amount;
            n_1Amount = curAmount;
        }

        return n_1Amount;
    }
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1)
            return nums[0];
            
        return max(robInRange(nums, 0, nums.size() - 2), robInRange(nums, 1, nums.size() - 1));
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
