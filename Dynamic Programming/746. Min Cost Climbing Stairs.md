---

## 題目說明
    
    You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

    You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.

    Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

    

    Example 1:

    Input: cost = [10,15,20]
    Output: 15
    Explanation: You will start at index 1.
    - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
    The total cost is 15.
    Example 2:

    Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: You will start at index 0.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
    - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
    - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
    - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
    The total cost is 6.
    

    Constraints:

    2 <= cost.length <= 1000
    0 <= cost[i] <= 999
        

## 解法
### 1. Bottom-Up without Tabulation
#### 思路

由於一次能爬一階或兩階，因此每次透過前一階和前兩階計算出當前的階梯會花費的最小值，在頂端時只需要看n-1階和n-2階所需花費最小值即可。
    
#### 代碼

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minCostClimbingStairs(vector<int>& cost) {
        int n_2MinCost = cost[0], n_1MinCost = cost[1];

        for (int idx = 2; idx < cost.size(); idx++) {
            int nMinCost = min(n_1MinCost, n_2MinCost) + cost[idx];
            n_2MinCost = n_1MinCost;
            n_1MinCost = nMinCost;
        }

        return min(n_1MinCost, n_2MinCost);
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(1)
