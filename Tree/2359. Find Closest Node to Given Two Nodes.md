## 題目說明
    
You are given a directed graph of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1, where each node has at most one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array edges of size n, indicating that there is a directed edge from node i to node edges[i]. If there is no outgoing edge from i, then edges[i] == -1.

You are also given two integers node1 and node2.

Return the index of the node that can be reached from both node1 and node2, such that the maximum between the distance from node1 to that node, and from node2 to that node is minimized. If there are multiple answers, return the node with the smallest index, and if no possible answer exists, return -1.

Note that edges may contain cycles.

 

Example 1:


Input: edges = [2,2,3,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 1, and the distance from node 1 to node 2 is 1.
The maximum of those two distances is 1. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 1, so we return node 2.
Example 2:


Input: edges = [1,2,-1], node1 = 0, node2 = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: The distance from node 0 to node 2 is 2, and the distance from node 2 to itself is 0.
The maximum of those two distances is 2. It can be proven that we cannot get a node with a smaller maximum distance than 2, so we return node 2.
 

Constraints:

n == edges.length
2 <= n <= 105
-1 <= edges[i] < n
edges[i] != i
0 <= node1, node2 < n

## 解法
### 1. DFS
#### 思路

求某個點，從node1和node2到改點距離的最大值，是所有點的最小值。

因為每個點最多只有往外一條邊，因此可以單純用迴圈記錄下到所有點的距離，再做比較。

#### 代碼
```c++
/*
    1. node size: n(0~n-1)
    2. node has at most one outgoing edge
    3. minimize max(dist(node1, x), dist(node2, x))  
*/
class Solution {
private:
    // get distance from node to x(0~n-1) 
    vector<int> getDistance(vector<int> &edges, int curr) {
        int n = edges.size(), len = 0;
        vector<int> dist(n, -1);

        // dist[curr] == -1 to avoid circular
        while (curr != -1 && dist[curr] == -1) {
            dist[curr] = len++;
            curr = edges[curr];
        }

        return dist;
    }
public:
    int closestMeetingNode(vector<int>& edges, int node1, int node2) {
        vector<int> dist1, dist2;

        dist1 = getDistance(edges, node1);
        dist2 = getDistance(edges, node2);

        int minDist = INT_MAX;
        int n = edges.size(), result = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); ++i) {
            if (dist1[i] != -1 && dist2[i] != -1) {
                int maxDist = max(dist1[i], dist2[i]);
                if (maxDist < minDist) {
                    minDist = maxDist;
                    result = i;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(h) => 因為這是遞迴DFS，所以呼叫堆疊的最大深度是樹的高度。
