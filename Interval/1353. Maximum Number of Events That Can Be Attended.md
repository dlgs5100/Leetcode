## 題目說明

You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.

You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. You can only attend one event at any time d.

Return the maximum number of events you can attend.

 

Example 1:


Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.
Example 2:

Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= events.length <= 105
events[i].length == 2
1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 105

## 解法
### 1. greedy
#### 思路

用greedy的概念，先參加最早結束的event，因此透過sort的方式，將已經開始的event加進去min heap當中，接著刪除過期的event，接著每天參加一場。

#### 代碼
```c++
/*
    events = [[1,2],[3,4],[1,2],[1,2],[1,3]] => sort => [1,2],[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]
    day 1: heap: [1,2],[1,2],[1,2],[1,3], attend: [1,2]
    day 2: heap: [1,2],[1,2],[1,3], attend: [1,2]
    day 3: heap: [1,2],[1,3],[3,4], attend: [1,3], outdated: [1,2]
    day 4: heap: [3,4], attend: [3,4]
*/
#define START 0
#define END 1
class Solution {
public:
    int maxEvents(vector<vector<int>>& events) {
        if (events.empty())
            return 0;
        
        sort(events.begin(), events.end());

        priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minEndDay;
        int day = 1, i = 0, n = events.size(), count = 0;

        while (i < n || !minEndDay.empty()) {
            // event is stated
            while (i < n && events[i][START] <= day) {
                minEndDay.push(events[i][END]);
                i++;
            }

            // event is outdated
            while (!minEndDay.empty() && minEndDay.top() < day) {
                minEndDay.pop();
            }

            if (!minEndDay.empty()) {
                minEndDay.pop();
                count++;
            }

            day++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
};
```

- 時間複雜度：O(nlogn)
- 空間複雜度：O(n)
