## 題目說明

You are given an integer eventTime denoting the duration of an event, where the event occurs from time t = 0 to time t = eventTime.

You are also given two integer arrays startTime and endTime, each of length n. These represent the start and end time of n non-overlapping meetings, where the ith meeting occurs during the time [startTime[i], endTime[i]].

You can reschedule at most k meetings by moving their start time while maintaining the same duration, to maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event.

The relative order of all the meetings should stay the same and they should remain non-overlapping.

Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event.

 

Example 1:

Input: eventTime = 5, k = 1, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]

Output: 2

Explanation:



Reschedule the meeting at [1, 2] to [2, 3], leaving no meetings during the time [0, 2].

Example 2:

Input: eventTime = 10, k = 1, startTime = [0,2,9], endTime = [1,4,10]

Output: 6

Explanation:



Reschedule the meeting at [2, 4] to [1, 3], leaving no meetings during the time [3, 9].

Example 3:

Input: eventTime = 5, k = 2, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output: 0

Explanation:

There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings.

## 解法
### 1. sliding window
#### 思路

題目是要我找出移動k個meeting可以得到的最大連續空閒時間，那其實可以轉換成k+1長度的連續空閒時間，所以一開始就將空閒時間vector做出來，接這跑sliding window就可以了。

#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxFreeTime(int eventTime, int k, vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime) {
        int n = startTime.size();
        vector<int> gap(n + 1);

        // Calculate gaps between events
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            gap[i] = startTime[i] - endTime[i - 1];
        }
        gap[0] = startTime[0]; // before first event
        gap[n] = eventTime - endTime[n - 1]; // after last event

        // Sliding window of size k + 1
        int l = 0, r = k;
        int maxa = 0, sum = 0;

        // Initial window sum
        for (int w = l; w <= n && w <= r; w++) {
            sum += gap[w];
        }
        maxa = max(maxa, sum);

        // Slide the window
        while (r < n) {
            sum -= gap[l++];
            sum += gap[++r];
            maxa = max(maxa, sum);
        }

        return maxa;
    }
};
```

#### 複雜度分析

- 時間複雜度：O(n)
- 空間複雜度：O(n)
