## 題目說明

You are given a string s and an integer k. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the frequency of two characters, freq[a] - freq[b], in a substring subs of s, such that:

subs has a size of at least k.
Character a has an odd frequency in subs.
Character b has an even frequency in subs.
Return the maximum difference.

Note that subs can contain more than 2 distinct characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "12233", k = 4

Output: -1

Explanation:

For the substring "12233", the frequency of '1' is 1 and the frequency of '3' is 2. The difference is 1 - 2 = -1.

Example 2:

Input: s = "1122211", k = 3

Output: 1

Explanation:

For the substring "11222", the frequency of '2' is 3 and the frequency of '1' is 2. The difference is 3 - 2 = 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = "110", k = 3

Output: -1

 

Constraints:

3 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
s consists only of digits '0' to '4'.
The input is generated that at least one substring has a character with an even frequency and a character with an odd frequency.
1 <= k <= s.length

#### 代碼
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDifference(string s, int k) {
        int n = s.size(), ans = INT_MIN;
        
        for (int a = 0; a <= 4; a++) {
            for (int b = 0; b <= 4; b++) {
                if (a == b)
                    continue;

                vector<int> s1(n+1);
                vector<int> s2(n+1);
                
                for (int idx = 1; idx <= n; idx++) {
                    s1[idx] = s1[idx - 1] + (s[idx - 1] - '0' == a);// Create s1[i]: number of times digit a appears in s[0..i-1]
                    s2[idx] = s2[idx - 1] + (s[idx - 1] - '0' == b);
                }

                // g[pa][pb] 用來記錄當前最好的 (b-a) 值
                // pa: a 出現次數的 parity（0=偶數，1=奇數）
                // pb: b 出現次數的 parity（0=偶數，1=奇數）
                int g[2][2] = {{INT_MIN, INT_MIN}, {INT_MIN, INT_MIN}};
                int left = 0;

                for (int right = k; right <= n; right++) {
                    while (right - left >= k && s1[right] > s1[left] && s2[right] > s2[left]) 
                    {
                        int pa = s1[left] % 2;
                        int pb = s2[left] % 2;
                        g[pa][pb] = max(g[pa][pb], s2[left] - s1[left]);
                        left++;
                    }

                    // Step 5: Check if valid
                    int pa = s1[right] % 2;
                    int pb = s2[right] % 2;
                    int need = g[1 - pa][pb];
                    
                    if (need != INT_MIN) 
                    {
                        ans = max(ans, (s1[right] - s2[right]) + need);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return ans == INT_MIN ? -1 : ans;
    }
};
